transcript=\"[Music]\\nwatch this full series at the links in\\nthe description below and subscribe to\\nour YouTube channel to watch new mental\\nhealth videos every week I read the\\ncomments on all of our videos and some\\nviewers have left feedback that maybe I\\nhave narcissistic personality disorder\\nwell we're about to find out in this\\nsimulated therapy session with dr.\\nRomani it's all you now I'm gonna answer\\nquestions so Kyle you know as we think\\nabout the pattern of narcissism in you\\nplace I'm gonna start is your\\nrelationships okay can you tell me are\\nyou dating anyone right now\\nno you're not okay so we don't have that\\nif you think about your last\\nrelationship how was that emotionally\\nwas that an emotionally fulfilling\\nrelationship it was but I'm not a very\\nemotional person what do you mean by\\nthat it doesn't take a lot for me to\\nfeel like I'm emotionally filled up so\\nyou almost get overwhelmed by emotion\\nyes like if somebody is just like I love\\nyou oh my oh my gosh like have it your\\nown deal okay yeah that kind of pushed\\nback has anyone ever experienced that is\\nsomething hurtful oh yeah oh really like\\neverybody I've ever dated it's like I\\nwish you would just like show me you\\ncare I'm like I'm trying you're trying\\nyeah so you actually do try oh I try as\\nbest as I can and I remember one\\nconversation with an ex I said that my\\nex said I really need you to be more\\nemotionally available I need you to hold\\nmy hand and touch me and all these\\nthings and I said I've I've tried as\\nhard as I can and this is as much as you\\nwill ever get because I I cannot give\\nmore than this and if that's not enough\\nfor you then that's a decision you're\\ngonna have to make which I know now\\ngoing through therapy that was the wrong\\nthing to do I'm putting all the pressure\\non them to make the decision but that is\\nwhat happened are you different in that\\nsort of emotional space with your\\nfriends when you compare that to your\\npartners no I'm pretty I think it's all\\nlike I don't I don't want to I don't do\\nwell with the like I like compliments\\nmm-hmm but I don't lie\\nI just want to tell you that I love you\\noh my oh my god\\nlike okay thank you thank you I love you\\ntoo but do we really need to like talk\\nabout it alright so what do you do when\\nwell how do you react or feel when\\nsomebody's really sharing with you in\\ntheir own heavy emotional issue um well\\nI do feel like I'm a very good listener\\nand I do I really try my best not to\\noffer advice unless it's to ask for and\\nI I feel like I'm very comforting and I\\nwill share personal stories if they\\nrelate and if I feel like it's\\nappropriate because when I've when I\\nbrought personal things up to people and\\nI feel like they immediately start\\ntalking about their experience I get\\nannoyed I'm like oh my mom died when I\\nwas 16 and they're just like oh my mom\\ndied when I was 20 I never got my oh\\nthis isn't about you right now I try to\\nmake sure that I keep it about them and\\nonly share things that I think are\\nrelevant and I would I know I we've been\\ntalking about narcissism but I would say\\nand empathetic and I am sympathetic okay\\nnow my caveat to that is if you you\\nbroke up with your boyfriend\\ntwo years ago and this is the 53rd time\\nyou've needed to get on the phone to\\ntalk about the break-up I'm not gonna be\\nable that work or some pathetic more get\\nover it so it's a limited yeah because\\nsweetheart let's keep it moving okay all\\nright I mean that could hurt someone's\\nfeelings though yeah I couldn't you know\\nand then that's you know that where that\\n53rd time T you may feel excessive\\nsometimes people need to talk about it\\n153 times before they finally let it go\\ndo you feel like you're able to get in\\nto understand where another person is\\ncoming from yes emotionally you do yeah\\nI always I almost always understand\\nwhere somebody's coming huh yeah there\\nmay be a few times where I really don't\\nunderstand how you could feel that way\\nbut almost always I understand where\\nthey're coming from but other people\\nhave called you out there you have other\\npeople have said that to you that you're\\nnot being empathic that that's missing\\nright now no nothing being not\\npathing or not or unsympathetic mostly\\nthat I'm just that I'm not even motion\\nalone okay okay got it\\nalright so you said you like you lucky\\nit compliments you just said how\\nimportant are those compliments to you\\nwell today they are not as important as\\nthey were probably five years ago okay\\nand what changed I'll be very\\ntransparent what changed\\nI was I was online getting cyber bullied\\nto the point of exhaustion and I don't\\nmean cyber boy like you're dumb I mean\\nlike kill yourself we're gonna find you\\nI hope you get aids and die like the\\nworst worst public and it was just\\nmonotonous because the Internet can be a\\nterrible place and I had a conversation\\nwith a friend and she mentioned\\nsomething like well those words don't\\nmean anything that's just a random\\nperson's opinion right you don't know\\nand if they're not even basing it on any\\nright we're just trying to be much their\\nown recha and I understood that but then\\nin that the same token I thought then if\\nsomebody says something really nice to\\nme I also can't give that with in those\\nspaces yeah because if it's a random\\nperson on the internet it says you're\\nthe best it's like we don't even know\\nwho I am yeah right I could be the work\\nyou don't know so it was that point\\nwhere I started to take opinions a\\nlittle more logically well I'm like\\nthat's a nice thing to hear but I'm not\\ngonna put a lot of weight on right\\nbecause if I do that I immediately have\\nto put weight on somebody saying I\\nshould kill okay I mean that's very\\ncircumspect a lot of people aren't that\\nwise you know that they thanks for the\\ncompliment or they won't they'll just\\nonly focus on the one or the other but\\nrealize that both especially when\\nthey're from sources where you don't\\nknow the people are actually equally\\nsort of irrelevant when one interview we\\ndid you said Kyle you are such a good\\ninterviewer and I was like Oh have been\\nso much because I've interviewed you\\nwe've worked together that's true now\\nwhat if I don't do that what if you're\\nnot what if you go through a whole busy\\nday doing whatever it is you're doing\\nand not once that day you get any\\nrecognized\\nvalidation no one says anything -\\neveryone's caught up in their own stuff\\nand then you go home at the end of the\\nday I think I would be fine you think\\nyou'd be okay yeah I mean that happens\\nand I'm fine right so it's not like the\\nworld falls apart do you use social\\nmedia yeah and is it matter to you\\nit matters to me from I'll be very be\\nreally honest in these mock there\\nbesides it matters to me from a career\\nlevel okay yeah I think if I wasn't if I\\nwasn't having a career in front of the\\ncamera I might not even be able to okay\\nalright well then okay that's important\\nto know because it is a tool and it\\nincreasingly it's become an essential\\ntool even if you want to say I'm above\\nall the social medias I don't even know\\nit's just not something that takes a lot\\nof joy I doesn't mean you joy and it's\\nnot how you want to spend your time\\nyou're right\\nyeah how you'd want to spend your time\\nokay but it's you like compliments you\\nparticularly like compliments if they\\ncame from someone who can offer it in a\\nmeaningful way because they've actually\\nobserved you doing it but they don't\\nfeel like a necessity yeah okay so let\\nme ask you this when you think about\\nwhat you hope I know you're not in a\\nrelationship now but I imagine that\\nsomeday you hope to be in a long-term\\nrelationship when you think about what\\nyou want that relationship to look what\\nare your thoughts well my the thing I\\nlove most out of any relationship is the\\nability to be honest and transparent\\nwithout fear of getting lashed at\\nbecause I'm always honest and\\ntransparent even if it the consequences\\naversive and I want that quality and my\\npartner I want them to be honest I never\\nwant to guess what you're thinking\\nI want to never I don't want to be like\\noh no I'm fine if you go out don't worry\\nI'll just stay here by myself I go\\nyou're clearly lying you know I don't\\nlike to play that game and then someone\\nwho is independent I don't want to\\ncomplete somebody I don't want to make\\nsomebody happy I want them to be happy\\nand complete as they are just as I feel\\nI'm happy complete as I am and I'm not\\nlooking for anybody to complete me hmm\\nI'm just looking for someone to enjoy\\nlife with okay alright so it's a healthy\\nconceptualization of what a relationship\\nis that what are your measures of\\nsuccess\\nwhoo that's such a good question and I\\nthought about that a lot yet I don't\\nknow if I have a concise answer but I'll\\ndo my best which is I think being\\nsuccessful is having the freedom to do\\nwhat you want to do and have it feel\\nlike it's the thing that you should be\\ndoing so I I don't just do this because\\nI get paid for it I do this because I\\nenjoy being on this side of the camera\\nand I do this because I enjoy reaching\\neverybody else on the other side of the\\ncamera I also enjoy that we're talking\\nabout mental health and not what\\nHalloween candy is gonna be big this\\nyear which to me isn't as big of a deal\\nlike I love that what we're doing is\\nimpactful and influential and I think if\\npeople can find themselves in a scenario\\nlike that where they're doing what they\\nwant to do they have the freedom to do\\nit and it feels like what they should be\\ndoing because I would want to also you\\nknow run a sushi restaurant but I don't\\nthink that's what I should be doing so\\nthis also feels like what I should be\\ndoing so I think when you have both of\\nthose together that is successful and so\\nI don't think money is an indicator of\\nsuccess by itself but we obviously use\\nmoney as an indication of how well a\\ncompany does or sure what kind of\\nlifestyle yeah right exactly and I don't\\neven know if happiness is an indicator\\nof success because I think there's\\nsomething deeper than that\\nnot to get too philosophical but for you\\nit's really doing doing what you love\\nyes and having the freedom to do what\\nyou love for some people that's not\\npossible because I mean I pay in kind of\\nthing so that that's that's how you'd\\nconsider success do you feel that that\\nyou you apply that definition to other\\npeople I don't know what you mean by\\nthat so in other words when you meet a\\nperson we judge people when we meet them\\non the basis of success whether we mean\\nto or not and at the most extreme if we\\nsaw somebody who was sort of I don't\\nknow disheveled in the street and didn't\\nseem like they were doing very well\\nnot judge them as successful and if we\\nsaw someone stepping out of an\\nincredibly expensive car and going to\\nexpress the expensive restaurant have\\nrather you know well-appointed home\\nwe might be use him as successful when\\nyou think about other people how would\\nyou judge success in them well I would\\nhave to know somebody I feel like before\\nI could do that\\nokay if I went to if I saw somebody get\\nout of a $300,000 car in front of a\\nfive-star hotel I'd be like whoa good\\njob you know and then if I saw somebody\\nand rags on the side of the street I\\nwould go oh my gosh I hope they're okay\\nand they're not freezing to death or\\nwhatever I don't know if I would say so\\nin that scenario yeah the person who's\\nwalking into the hotel out of a car is\\nmore successful than the person on the\\nstreet is homeless but you know it\\ndoesn't mean you know game one may not\\nbe that that person who got out of the\\nfancy car necessarily made better\\nchoices they made a financial choices\\nokay that works okay yeah all right and\\nI always said I would date\\nI will ask me like would you ever date\\nsomeone who made like twenty thousand\\ndollars a year I go if they were the\\nbest at that thing okay like if they\\nweren't the best at I think well then\\nthey better be trying real hard to get\\nbecause I don't want someone who's just\\nlike coasting okay if they go I really\\nlove making tables and I only make\\ntwenty grand a year cake and I'm I'd be\\nlike I then you're at least you're\\nmaking okay you know all right you're in\\nan interesting profession Kyle you're a\\npublic person okay and when you're a\\npublic person people know who you are\\nright and that can that can have some\\nrisks you know it might give people\\ncarte blanche to criticize you but it\\nalso benefits you know if you're\\nrecognized you might get a special\\nbenefit of some kind whatever form it\\ntakes does that matter to you it doesn't\\nmatter if I get a special benefit yeah\\nlet me again I'm saying that you're a\\npublic person do you expect it no no\\nbill let's be real I'm public compared\\nto like somebody who maybe works in a\\nrestaurant but not Ryan Seacrest and I\\nmean met circle videos get a lot of\\nviews sure I I don't expect any of that\\nand I don't think I would ever expect do\\nyou covet it having that like ability to\\nyou know\\npeople making parting the seas for you\\nhere comes Kyle no that would feel\\nuncomfortable okay alright so that kind\\nof attention on you yeah and especially\\nnow that I'm thinking about especially\\nif it was only because they saw in that\\ncircle video right well they give they\\nif I went to a restaurant and they were\\nlike we have a table right up here and I\\nwas like oh cool thank you I would feel\\nspecial because they just did just\\nhappen to happen yeah but if they were\\nlike because you're from med circle we\\ngave this table be like why because I\\ndid a job right cuz I did my everyone\\neveryone did so the producer doesn't get\\na table because she just worked as hard\\nas everybody else but she doesn't get\\none because she didn't ask questions on\\na couch absolutely okay alright so how\\ndo you deal with frustration mm-hm\\nsometimes I go eat fast food sometimes I\\ntake a nap\\nsometimes I have a fake conversation\\nwith myself or the person that I'm\\nfrustrated with and just get it all out\\nlike that but I try to if I feel\\nfrustration coming on I'm pretty good\\nabout getting under control before it's\\nout of control his rage ever been a\\nproblem for you mmm what let's say you\\nwere talking about I mean I always I'm\\nalways interested to hear how people\\ndeal with you know one of the most\\nfrustrating things we could do is deal\\nwith customer service yeah that's right\\nyou're on hold for a long time then the\\nperson answers it's clear that they you\\nknow they're probably answered you're\\none of a million calls they might even\\nbe working for 20 companies that day you\\ncan't get to the person who can answer\\nthe question and they keep clearly the\\nreading from a script' you get\\nfrustrated\\nwhat would you deal with the call like\\nthat okay well I'll tell you very\\nhonestly today I would deal with a call\\nlike that I would be frustrated huh but\\nI would deal with it and what I think is\\nthe most efficient way to a solution for\\nwhatever the reason I'm calling now ten\\nyears ago it would have not been that\\nway I would have been irate screaming\\nyelling I mean just just so it did my my\\nanger right we're not equal what was\\nactually happening happen what caused\\nthe change because I realized it was\\nI was having I was losing okay I was\\nlosing all right I still didn't get my\\ncable bill paid and now I'm angry and\\nall worked up for a stupid reason and I\\nknew this would go on for as long as I\\nwas alive so I might as well make these\\nthings not angry today I had to call a\\nroofing company and they had not called\\nme back they had not emailed they said\\nthey were gonna do this and this and\\nthis and they did none of those things\\nand normally 10 years ago I would have\\ntold them what was up today I said guys\\nthis is what's happened I don't know why\\nyou're promising one thing but not\\ndelivering but can you please XYZ all\\nright I already know and that just makes\\neverything better\\nuh-huh okay when you when you overall\\nthink about how you feel about your life\\nright now\\nhmm how do you how do you feel about\\nlike where you're at in life well I was\\njust thinking about this yesterday I\\ndon't what a night I don't think this is\\nthe most overall content and happy that\\nI've ever been in my life ever and that\\nincludes the time I had my first dream\\njob of working with animals mm-hmm\\nwhen I thought oh man it doesn't get\\nbetter than this this is this is it for\\nme it was my childhood dream to work\\nwith animals I got to do it but now I\\nlook at life and five pillars and\\nfriends family finances career which are\\ndifferent and health and all of those\\nare so good right now that I like I\\nthink this is the best it's ever been\\nyeah okay so I'm gonna I'm gonna put a\\nsort of hypothetical to you Greg hey\\nthings are good yeah anyone's able to be\\ndoing doing well when things in those in\\nthose realms are good to be honest with\\nyou no not at all sorry I will say some\\npeople even with all those things good\\nthey still find something to harp at but\\nmost would tomorrow mentor Collette did\\nyou go yeah okay you get fired okay we\\nfound someone who found someone else to\\ndo your job you're not.you know or and\\nyou love this job you may\\nvery clear you love what you get to do\\nhere love the people you work with how\\ndo you how would you cope with something\\nlike that I would honestly just throw\\nmyself back into the other in front of\\ncamera projects that I'm not doing\\nbecause I'm okay how would you feel\\nabout yourself if okay if I'll just add\\nto your hypothetical if they fired me\\nbecause they the company was like we\\njust we just don't want they want a\\nwoman now you know we've had all these\\ngreat these had all these great\\ninterviews with you're a guy we're on a\\nwoman so it's not you like you could not\\nmorph into a woman so you couldn't do so\\nyeah no but even though I can't warfarin\\na woman that would be devastated I would\\nokay yeah I'd be really upset mm-hmm\\nyeah why well because I'm losing like my\\nthing mm-hmm\\nI'm losing I'm losing a really important\\nthing in my life yeah and I I did and I\\ndon't want to lose it for any for any\\nreason yeah so that would hurt a lot\\nwould you be able to let go of it yeah\\nof course mm-hmm yeah yeah and I would\\nwatch like the next two videos and then\\ncritique everything she did and be like\\nthat's not good that's not and then I\\nwould stop watching the videos because\\nit goes be too hard I would just move on\\nwith my life okay yeah um how do you\\nhandle criticism I'd say 90% of the time\\nincredibly well no what about the other\\n10% terrible why what what\\ndifferentiates the 90 normally the\\nsource the source what kind of source\\ncan be that part of that ten percent\\nwhich throws you off a source that would\\nhave no reason to critique those\\nsubjects that we're talking about uh-huh\\nit's like I see you know I I was an\\nanimal behaviorist for 15 years mm-hmm\\nso you're a first-time dog owner and you\\nwant to set me down and talk about how\\nto potty train your dog and I'm not\\ngonna take those critiques very well\\nbecause I just don't think they know\\nokay but if you're gonna critique me on\\nmental health I'm going to be all-in\\nright if\\ndirector critiques me on my hosting\\nperformance and be like yeah I need to\\nlisten to that yeah do you have any\\npeople in your life that you feel\\ngenuinely jealous or covetous of their\\nlives that I'm jealous of their lives\\noccasionally I'm jealous of one friend\\nbecause she's done so well in the\\nindustry in her career so well in an\\nindustry that's so competitive and I\\nknow there's a couple friends who have\\nreally great marriages and relationships\\nand I guess I am jealous I don't think\\nI'm like jealous where I can't you know\\nmy friends and have you member or would\\nyou maybe I should ask you or have you\\never take advantage of a person to\\nforward your cause or get your needs met\\nof course mm-hmm yeah I think when you\\nsay take advantage I feel like it's it\\nsounds like I didn't they didn't know I\\nwas doing it but I'm pretty transparent\\nI go hey do you know that person can you\\nemail them for me I would like to meet\\nthem you know like let's do it so yeah I\\ndo that has it ever happened in a way\\nthat were someone's like oh here comes\\nKyle thank you so you're okay I mean if\\nif someone watched that and I have done\\nthat tell me because I don't think\\nthat's the case at all yeah so how do\\nyou I mean none of us are perfect\\nwe all have parts of ourselves that\\nwe're not fond of no how do you manage\\nthat part of yourself well I go to\\ntherapy okay good yeah I read a lot I\\ntry to be as honest with myself as I am\\nwith everybody else\\nand there's also a point of just knowing\\nthat I'm not perfect okay ever like and\\nyou're never going to get to a place\\nwhere you're like I and I'm done like\\nself improvement over and so I think\\nthat's how I manager mm-hmm what's your\\nwhat's your favorite part of yourself\\nyour favorite aspect of yourself\\nprobably my ability to have a relentless\\npursuit on whatever my target is okay\\nwhether that's a career\\ngetting my dog to do what she needs to\\ndo anything finances relationships\\nfriendships family once I narrow in on\\nsomething then that's it I mean listen\\nafter this conversation I'm not you do\\nnot have narcissistic sorry yeah I know\\nyou were could you could you imagine\\nokay but I trust me I've done interviews\\nwith people in the media where I'm like\\noh absolutely if I got to do this with\\nthem I think it would be quite different\\nyou know listen you brought up some\\ninteresting issues that I poked at you\\nknow one was that sort of that\\nemotionality you're like I can't always\\nbring it you know you own that I can't\\nalways bring it and that if that person\\ndoes call me fifty three times there's a\\npoint at which I'm done that could be\\nexperienced by another person as a lack\\nof empathy or coldness that was probably\\nthe only little like little red flag\\nthat popped up a little bit for me you\\nknow I would say to you\\nthere are peuta Klee and clinically be\\nmindful of that aspect of yourself that\\nthere are times when you may not have\\nthe emotional bandwidth to take\\nsomething on but a human relationship is\\na reciprocal space and that there are\\ntimes that people are going to expect\\nyou to maybe kind of be bigger than that\\nemotional space you can be it would be\\nexhausting for you on a daily basis I\\ndon't think you should be a therapist\\nyou know I don't think like that would\\nplay upon your strengths to be honest\\nbut I do think that you know it could\\nsomebody who is if you love someone and\\nthey're going through a hard time they\\nmay need more of that space from you and\\nlike I'd say so much of how narcissism\\nis addressed if you're addressing it\\nclinically is mindfulness and every one\\nof us can bring mindfulness into our\\nlives you're not even a narcissistic I\\nmean we look at narcissism as always\\nhold on you you said I'm not even nurses\\nyeah I don't really know I mean the\\nclosest you got was like that little bit\\nthat emotional you know kind of clip\\nmisses you I should have been more I\\nfeel like I need to be a little\\nnarcissistic to be like you you if I was\\ngonna sit here and dissect you sure\\ncould I say there was one or two things\\nthat you said there was like mmm\\nsuperficial like how often do you you\\nknow do you are you like are you big\\ninto stuff do you care about your whole\\nlike what you wear and what you drive\\nand all of that I don't have a car and I\\ndon't think I've bought a piece of\\nclothing it what so I mean we\\nso but if a person had a phenomenally\\ngreat car it doesn't mean they're not\\nempathic we look at it holistically\\nyou're you're telling me that your\\nmeasure of success is to get meaning and\\npurpose from your work that's it\\nactually sort of the opposite of\\nnarcissism and in fact when we work with\\nnarcissistic clients one of the things\\nwe try to do is meaning and purpose\\nfocused work thinking that if we can\\nbubble that up to the surface it might\\nhelp sort of address some of that\\nemptiness and that insecurity I hear\\nthat you're able to be you know strong\\nin the face of meaningful criticism and\\nthat yeah when the criticism comes from\\na place where you're like seriously you\\nhave no place saying this it was a very\\nnormal kind of a reaction back to that\\nyou know if your your ratios more were\\nlike 20 80 like 80% of the time I can't\\ntolerate criticism that would give me\\npause yeah you know you're not talking\\nabout a superficial world you're talking\\nabout when you do fall into a loving\\nrelationship that you want it to be\\nwhere you're both are healthy and\\ngrowing together not that I need a hot\\npartner I know if I were watching this I\\nwould go well yeah he just talked to the\\nnarcissist expert for five hours and\\nthey did a therapy session so he's just\\ngoing to deliver the answers to make him\\nright see Narcisa I can tell everybody I\\nwas very honest I'm all that's one of my\\nweak and weaknesses and strengths but I\\nmean is there anything that you can add\\nto did this feel like a valid session to\\nyou or did you feel like I was putting\\non here's the thing\\nwhen we're looking at something like\\nnarcissism or narcissistic personality\\nit's a slow burn in in reality it could\\nhave taken as weeks or even months of\\nsessions for these patterns to come\\nclear I've worked with clients it took\\nme six to nine months for me to really\\nsee like oh now I know exactly what I'm\\ndealing with you can get some of the\\nsuperficial narcissism at a dinner party\\nbut the real depths work to get this\\nthat could take a long time I know you I\\nhad that advantage College I'm working\\nwith you for months so you know I know\\nenough about you but what I could be\\nlying you know you could be lying and\\nanyone could be lying in therapy and you\\nknow you could all listen you're in an\\nindustry that celebrates superficial\\nvalidation seeking stuff and you do like\\nbeing on this side of the camera maybe\\nany of us that you want to be on this\\nside of the camera needs to take a good\\nhard look inside and say why is that\\nwhy is it more important for us to be on\\nthis side than that psychos or those are\\nabsolutely equal roles yeah Timmy so\\nthere is some self-examination that\\nmeans to happen there you know I I would\\nover the course of longer-term therapy\\nwe look at how do you intersect in your\\nrelationships\\nmaybe this pattern of low emotionality\\nis actually something we do need to be\\nmore concerned about and as I got to\\nknow more about you and saw how it\\nsurfed it surfaced with family with\\nfriends with partners with coworkers\\nI might start to see a pattern there\\nthat's not just low emotionality maybe\\nit would evidence as lack of empathy so\\nthis is something that we're good we\\nwould have to continue to kind of pull\\nup but you certainly didn't come in here\\nkind of arrogant and brash you're\\nwilling to put yourself out there in\\nthis kind of a platform so right out the\\ngate there's a transparency you use that\\nword a lot I don't know that many\\nnarcissist use the word transparency\\nunless it's a buzzword but you do raise\\nan important point so it can be tricky\\nlast thing because I know we're going a\\nlittle long can you give me maybe two\\nbecause of my inability to be as\\nemotionally available as people want me\\nto be has hurt me yeah better yes and\\nit's something that if I want to have a\\nsuccessful relationship in the future\\nI'm gonna need yeah so can you give me\\nlike two things that I can do to\\npractice that now while I'm not in a\\nrelationship\\nlisten in case and listen to people in\\nsituations where it's not as high-stakes\\nyou know in a relationship it's higher\\nstakes but like you know don't be that\\nperson is like a stupid person on an\\nairplane is telling me their story you\\nknow I'm so like oh yeah as soon as I\\ncan airplane I'm like uh yeah I gotta go\\nalone practice it a little bit you know\\ndo it with with smaller with friends you\\nactually like also listen to your\\nfriends starts telling you their\\nemotional stuff say uh oh man you know\\nwatch those reactions because for some\\npeople for whom sharing emotional stuff\\nmay not be easy and they see you going\\nlike this that might be enough to make\\nthem more reluctant to share in that\\nspace you've got to watch your\\nnonverbals you've got a and you have to\\npractice it I mean it's in order to love\\npeople we sometimes have to do things\\nthat don't always feel comfortable for\\nus because that's love you know is you\\nknow to really\\nbe there for people and hear them and\\ngive richness and validation to their\\nstories by hearing them with an open\\nheart oh god I can do that though I\\nliterally yeah can practice this with\\npeople because right now you're so right\\nI avoid it at all cost because I'm like\\nothers as important I'm not practicing\\nacting so how do I be able to do it when\\nit matters it's not that it doesn't\\nmatter now but whenever you like it\\ncould be like a friend Connie yammering\\non about something like that and I could\\njust I could put my phone away and just\\ngo yeah and don't be yeah you don't need\\nto be like you know all like you know\\ntrippy and all that like really just you\\nknow lie back in the sofa and hear it\\nput that phone away be present with it\\ndon't let other people's emotions be a\\nplace of fear for us you know because\\nthey're not asking you to take them it's\\nnot like they're trying to unload cargo\\non you they're just wanting to they want\\nthe simple act of another human being\\nlistening to them because that's really\\nwhere a relationship happens they'll\\nsend more days than not the only thing a\\npartner and two partners might talk\\nabout is who's taking the car this\\nmorning and did you remember to get the\\nmilk you know that not every day is a\\nbig-ticket day in a relationship one of\\nthose big ticket days happen those are\\nthe bridges that carry the relationship\\nto the next level and that's where\\nnarcissistic people can't go so while\\nI'm not seeing those patterns for you I\\ndo think practice it because being there\\nfor another person emotionally is a\\npractice skill and in our\\ntechnologically soaked womb people are\\nnot good at being there for other people\\nthey're so distracted they're like\\nfondling their phones put it away\\nlook at that person be present with them\\nstop doing your grocery list in your\\nmind and be in the room yes oh my gosh\\nthis was so good for me loved ones and\\nhopefully you know a partner or even\\nwhen you're dating this create a\\nhealthier space and if you notice this\\nbroad pattern and someone else who can't\\nbe with your emotional space at all and\\nthat's also a red flag for you but like\\nlisten you know I'm not you don't seem\\nlike mr. narcissism you're you know\\ngiven that you're in this industry you\\nlive in LA you know you're young you're\\nyou know all the things that kind of are\\nthe flame under that yeah under that pot\\nkind of thing doesn't seem to be\\nhappening of a holistic healthy sense of\\nyourself remember\\nyou have a solid sense of yourself the\\nrest emanates from that and so I believe\\nthat I've been up that hard a little bit\\nmore and my future spouse thanks you oh\\nhe'll be a much better listener by then\\nthank you guys for watching this\\nsimulated therapy session with myself\\nand dr.

During the session, Kyle discusses his tendency to get overwhelmed by emotions, his need for authenticity and independence in relationships, and how he handles compliments and criticism. He shares personal experiences, like being cyberbullied, and reflects on his definitions of success and measures of personal fulfillment.\\n\\nDr. Romani explores whether Kyle's difficulty with emotional vulnerability might be perceived as a lack of empathy, although she generally finds him to be transparent and self-aware, which are not common traits in narcissists. While acknowledging some potential areas to monitor, such as being fully present in emotional situations, Dr. Romani does not conclude that Kyle has narcissistic personality disorder. Instead, she suggests he practice being more emotionally available to improve future relationships.\"), Session(date='2024-01-02', videos=[Video(url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDlWSR7Ohck', transcript=\"- I have pretty much been\\nmedicated my entire life,\\nfrom the age of nine 'til today.\\nI've had moments where,\\nfor a multitude of reasons\\nhave gone off my meds,\\nand that has always resulted in a relapse.\\nI mean, it is the deepest, darkest,\\nI mean, life doesn't even make sense\\nwhen I get into that deep, deep space.\\n- I wonder what it's like\\njust to put that on the table to say,\\nwe're gonna take a deeper\\nlook at this depression,\\nthat this is what you wanna\\nwork on for your benefit.\\nWhat do you notice inside\\njust as we get clear\\nthat that's what we're gonna work on?\\nHi, Kyle, what's the problem\\nyou'd like to work on today?\\n- Well, I was diagnosed with depression\\nwhen I was nine years old.\\nYou think we would have\\nfigured it out by now, I'm 35.\\nI have pretty much been\\nmedicated my entire life\\nfrom the age of nine 'til today.\\nI've had moments where,\\nfor a multitude of reasons,\\nhave gone off my meds,\\nand that has always resulted in what I,\\nand at the time my providers,\\nwould consider a relapse.\\nI never took myself to the hospital.\\nI was always able to find a doctor\\nwho could see me right away\\nbut it was, I mean, if I\\ncouldn't have done that,\\nI would have driven to the hospital.\\nI mean, it is the deepest, darkest...\\nI mean, life doesn't even make sense\\nwhen I get into that deep, deep space.\\nSo that's happened probably, not probably,\\nit's happened three times as an adult,\\neach time corresponding to going off meds.\\nI'm pretty good with my\\ndepression right now.\\nI had a relapse, so to speak,\\na minor one in May\\nwhen I was transitioning medication,\\nand that was disaster, not great.\\nSo I guess, but I bring\\nall that up to say,\\nI am still not...\\nI've still not been okay with or accepted\\nthat I will probably be medicated\\nfor the rest of my life\\nfor this depression.\\nI don't like doing that.\\nI don't like, every morning,\\nI have to take 40 milligrams of Prozac,\\nand when I take it, I go,\\noh man, I wish I didn't have to take this.\\nAnd then when I feel\\ngood, my brain still says,\\nyou got this,\\nlike, I can do it.\\nI don't need this med.\\nBut then the logical part\\nof my brain reminds me,\\nif you go off of this,\\nin two to six weeks,\\nyou're gonna regret it.\\nAnd I'm grappling with this.\\nI can treat it, I can manage it,\\nI know exactly what I need to do,\\nand I will do it,\\nbecause the alternative\\nis not anything I'm willing to do.\\nBut oh my gosh, am I\\ngonna be 95 years old,\\nand then taking this\\npill still every morning,\\nI don't know.\\n- Yeah, so I hear a couple\\nof different things.\\nSo, the depression has\\nbeen an issue in the past,\\nit's not kind of rearing\\nits head right now,\\nbut concerns about medication\\nand whether or not\\nyou want to be on medication long-term\\nand whether that's an option for you.\\nAnd, we can talk about medications\\na little bit separately\\nin regard to when people do wanna try\\nand taper off medications,\\nunfortunately, they often\\ncome off very, very quickly,\\nand statistically people do better\\ncoming off over like a year,\\nbecause if we think about the fact\\nthat it takes four to six weeks\\nto have the full effect of a dose change,\\nthen it's going to take that much time\\nwith every dose decrease\\nfor your brain to kind of recalibrate.\\nSo we can really throw\\npeople into withdrawal\\nand pop their symptoms,\\nand you're mentioning\\nthere's some real conflict\\nover being on medication.\\nAnd so that's something that\\nwe can certainly look at.\\nI'm wondering what makes sense to you\\nas far as looking at the medications\\nversus looking at kind of the\\norigins of the depression,\\nand maybe getting specific about\\nwhen your last episode was,\\nto be able to see if\\nwe can get underneath.\\nBut we can take either path\\nthat sounds right for you.\\n- Well, I think I'm the second path\\nof the origins of depression\\nsound more in line with what I would want.\\n- Okay, yeah, great.\\nAnd so let's make sure\\nthat we do what you want.\\nThis therapy is yours,\\nand that we can really make sure that\\nwe're focusing on your goals,\\nand so we can talk about meds,\\nbut being able to understand what happens\\nis such a key piece in\\nbalance with the medication,\\nso that we can work on\\nhow you might operate in the world\\nthat might contribute to the depression.\\nAnd so we're clear, we're gonna work on\\nkind of getting to know\\nabout this depression\\nand how it affects you,\\nand maybe the origins of it.\\nAnd before we even get started,\\nI wonder what it's like,\\njust to put that on the table to say,\\nwe're gonna take a deeper\\nlook at this depression,\\nthat this is what you wanna\\nwork on for your benefit.\\nWhat do you notice inside\\njust as we get clear\\nthat that's what we're gonna work on?\\n- Oh, excitement.\\nAnd I know that that's\\nprobably an obscure answer,\\nI get excited for this,\\nbecause this is like\\nI've had this little ugly pet\\nfollow me around my whole life.\\nI mean, since I was a young, young child,\\nfive, six years old, I\\nremember this feeling,\\nand so it's always here.\\nWhether I am medicated or\\nnot medicated, it's there.\\nSo when I get to sit across\\nfrom somebody like you\\nand say, all right, let's\\nlook at this ugly pet,\\nbecause I don't look at it\\nthat much, Dr. Lamb, I don't.\\nI work, and I see my friends,\\nand I play with my dog, I do my life\\nwith this ugly pet.\\nSo to have this space\\nwhere we're gonna actually\\nlook at this ugly pet\\nand see what we can do,\\nI get excited about that.\\n- I'm glad to hear it,\\nbecause for some people\\ncoming in, in therapy,\\nit can be really anxiety-provoking,\\nthey may not wanna look, and so...\\n- Yeah, no, that's not me.\\nI've been in therapy since\\nnine years old, I love it.\\nI get on the couch,\\nI'm like, hey, what's your name,\\nlet's do it, let's get into it, I love it.\\n- Wonderful, wonderful.\\nSo could we look at a specific example\\nof your last kind of\\nrelapse into depression,\\nwhat was going on,\\nand just start to get\\nsome details around it\\nso we can see if we can formulate\\nan understanding of what happens for you.\\n- So it happened in May,\\nironically during Mental Health Month,\\nand it probably started\\na little before that\\nand went past May,\\nbut May was really the big chunk of it.\\nA lot of things were happening.\\nOne, Mental Health Month\\nis a big month for me professionally,\\nso we were very busy,\\nme and the whole team here at MedCircle.\\nI literally just now I was like,\\nright, we're doing MedCircle right now,\\nI'm not in therapy.\\nAnd so I was just busier\\nthan I normally was.\\nI don't know why.\\nEvery year, whether I'm\\nindependent of medication,\\nI get depressed around\\nthat time, every year.\\nI mean, and I don't even anticipate it,\\nso it's not like my brain's going,\\nhere it comes,\\nI just move through my life and I go,\\nwait, why is this happening?\\nWhy is this happening?\\nAnd I go, oh yeah, it's\\nthat time of the year again.\\nIt's like reverse seasonal\\ndepression or something.\\nThe spring comes, and I just,\\nfor that period of time.\\nNow, my birthday's in April,\\nI've had therapists tell me,\\nit's probably 'cause of your birthday,\\nand I really don't think it is,\\nbut maybe it is.\\nAnd the other big catalyst...\\nAnd then I went off my meds,\\nI was switching meds.\\nI went from Prozac to something else.\\nThat didn't work,\\nand I went into something else,\\nand there were gaps in there\\nthat I wasn't on meds at all,\\nand that was a big catalyst.\\nAnd then the other part was,\\nI don't know what happened,\\nif all my friends got together and said,\\nlet's all have a problem\\nand bring it to Kyle,\\nbut every single person\\nI knew, it felt like,\\nwas coming to me with huge issues.\\nI'm getting divorced,\\nI have a chronic illness,\\nmy husband, XYZ.\\nI mean, major, major, big life issues.\\nAnd I gave them everything.\\nI go, here, you have all of me.\\nI got on flights,\\nI gave them everything.\\nI was like, here's my time, my energy,\\nmy money, my resources, everything.\\nSo when all of that came together\\nat the end of May,\\nI remember telling my\\ndad and my dad called me\\nand he goes, how are you,\\nand I said, I'm not gonna\\nhelp anybody anymore.\\nI'm done, I have nothing else to give.\\nI don't care who calls me,\\nwhat the problem is, I'm done.\\nI have nothing left to give anybody.\\nAnd then of course I'm like,\\nunless you need something to dad\\nthen I'll help you.\\nBut I just I couldn't do it.\\nI was drained,\\nI had nothing, I had nothing.\\n- And so is this a pattern for you?\\n- No, no, I don't think so.\\nAnd I am aware enough\\nhopefully to know that there,\\nI'm sure I have many patterns\\nthat I'm not aware of,\\nbut I never recall in my life\\ngiving myself so much to people\\nthat I am drained.\\nI don't recall that.\\n- Got it, so is it accurate to say that\\nin other times in your life\\nyou would set more boundaries\\nor let people know when you didn't have...\\n- Yes.\\n- So, just differentiating,\\nyou normally set better\\nboundaries as opposed to,\\nI don't really set boundaries,\\nbut I just got a tsunami of needs...\\n- Normally I said,\\nwell, now that you're\\nasking that question,\\nI over the last two years\\nhave really made an effort\\nto be incredibly empathic,\\nand I think that has a\\nlot to do with my job\\nbecause I see it, I hear it, all of that,\\nso I'm trying to be really empathic.\\nAnd perhaps, the pendulum swung\\ntoo far to one side where,\\nand I'm not saying what\\nI did is only empathy,\\nbut it might be in the same house as other\\nemotions that may be\\ngood in smaller doses,\\nbut all at once for me is a debilitating.\\n- Absolutely, I think\\nfor anyone that when,\\nit sounds like if I'm\\nhearing you correctly,\\nthat during this time\\nyou put everyone else\\nahead of your own needs.\\n- Yes, yes.\\n- And is that a pattern for you?\\nIs that a pattern for you?\\n- I don't think so.\\nI really think if you asked my friends,\\nthey'd be like, nah, he's kinda like...\\n- He's pretty good at\\ntaking care of himself.\\n- I don't think so.\\nBut I did have a psychiatrist tell me once\\nI was dating this guy\\nwho had a lot of issues.\\nAnd then, that sounded mean\\nwe all have issues, but...\\n- But he had a lot them.\\n- Yeah, and I've also\\nbefore my current career,\\nI was an animal trainer\\nand this therapist of mindset, Kyle,\\nyou naturally care for things.\\nYou have a whole job\\ndedicated caring for animals\\nwho are helpless.\\nI mean, they depend and rely on,\\nand now you're this relationship\\nwhere this person\\nis depending and relying on you.\\nYou may wanna look at why\\nyou are finding yourself\\nin these scenarios and situations\\nwhere everyone's depending\\nand relying on you.\\nAnd I said, yeah, maybe that,\\nwell, and here I am years later in this...\\nDuring may or during that time period\\nwhere I was in that position again.\\nAnd I have control of all of it, Dr. Lamb,\\nit's not as though I could say,\\nI could have said, no,\\nI can't do that for you, I'm sorry,\\nI said yes to everything.\\n- Yeah, and so that we don't\\nbeat you up about that,\\n'cause part of that, your\\nlanguage right around,\\nI have control of this,\\nsounds a little bit like a self-attack\\nas if you should have done\\nsomething differently.\\nAnd so I'm wondering if\\nwe can come into seriously\\nand try and understand why.\\n- Why what?\\n- Why during this time\\nwere your guards down?\\nWhy during this time,\\nwas there a draw to really\\ntake care of others,\\nat the expense of you?\\n- I know why, I know why.\\nI haven't thought about this.\\nI really, truly, truly, truly\\nhad not thought about this.\\nThis is my theory at least\\nbecause then I didn't have\\nto take care of myself.\\nIf I'm taking care of everybody else,\\nthen I'll have to think about me.\\nI don't have to think about,\\nI just moved to a new city.\\nWorking remote has really\\ntaken a toll on me,\\nthis is not meant,\\nI'm meant to sit in a\\nroom with you, Dr. Lamb,\\nnot like this.\\nAnd if I can be a part of\\neveryone else's problems,\\nthen I don't have to look at my problems.\\n- Beautiful, so we get really clear,\\nthat one of the primary\\nmechanisms that you may use\\nto avoid feeling sadness,\\ngrief, over loneliness,\\neverything that came with new place,\\nCOVID restrictions, all of this stuff,\\nyou can be distracted,\\nyou can avoid yourself\\nby taking care of others\\nand what an altruistic thing to do,\\nbut at the neglect of you.\\nAnd so we just start to see,\\nthat there's something about sitting with\\nand exploring, and feeling\\nwhat you were feeling at that time.\\nMed changes that weren't working,\\nthat's gonna bring up\\nfeelings towards the providers\\nthat were made the recommendations\\nand the failed recommendations.\\nSo there was something about being present\\nwith what you were feeling\\nor what you were going through,\\nthat whether consciously\\nor unconsciously made you anxious\\nand how'd you go take\\ncare of everyone else\\nto keep all of these\\npainful feelings at bay.\\nSo should we take a look,\\nat what these painful feelings were\\nthat were coming up?\\nAnd as you think about it now,\\nwhat feelings come up as you reflect on\\nhow bad it was in May\\nand what you were going through.\\n- Well, I hate to be the\\nperson that rebuttals this\\nwithout giving you an answer.\\n- No please.\\n- Part of what I was feeling was,\\nI recognize now we're due to me being\\nin this very deep state of depression.\\nAnd so it's hard for me to say to you, oh,\\nI was feeling disconnected from my family\\nbecause okay I was,\\nbut I wasn't disconnected from my family.\\nI was depressed.\\nDoes that make sense?\\nSo to me like the depressed feelings\\nare kind of fake feelings.\\nThat's how it kind of\\nhow I look at them...\\n- Super important to\\ndifferentiate, absolutely.\\nSo that you....\\nWell, there's a couple pieces here.\\nSo there's a huge\\ndifference between feeling\\nor being in a state of depression\\nwhere our thoughts are hopeless,\\nwe feel helpless,\\neverything is the worst.\\nThat's very different than\\nI'm connected with my family,\\nbut I can't get on a\\nplane and go see them,\\nand I've got feelings about that\\nor whatever the case may have been.\\nSo it can become a bit of a\\nchicken and the egg situation,\\nso that the depressed state\\nkeeps us from feeling what we're feeling\\nand that this can get muddled.\\nPeople often don't separate\\nout sadness and grief\\nfrom depression and they're\\nvery, very different,\\nand I think that's what\\nyou're highlighting, right?\\nIs that when you feel depressed\\nand when you're in a depressed state,\\nwhich in our model, would say,\\nthis is a defensive collapse\\naround real feelings\\nthat were coming up after\\na year of being isolated,\\nhaving to navigate all of\\nthese changes, a new move.\\nAnd while you were\\nconnected with your family,\\nI'm curious how connected you were.\\nBecause I think this is another place\\nwhere we can kind of sneaky\\nself-attack ourselves,\\nlike, well, I wasn't disconnected,\\nI was surrounded by people,\\nbut if I felt completely\\nalone with those people,\\nor if I wasn't really\\nseen by those people,\\nif my needs weren't actually met,\\nI'm gonna have feelings about that,\\nand then I might blame myself,\\nwell, they were there\\nbut my needs weren't getting met.\\nSo, I was alone and I did\\nhave feelings about it.\\nAnd so I'm curious what your environment\\nin regard to connection,\\nnot just connecting to\\ntake care of others,\\nbut you being seen.\\nIn the midst of these med changes,\\nfeeling really awful,\\nwho was there to see you, to support you?\\n- Well, I mean, my best friend\\nlives across the street.\\nSo, he was certainly there,\\nand he was the only person\\nI really told this to.\\nAnd when I told him,\\nI didn't even tell him\\nthe way I'm telling you,\\nI told him like, look,\\nwe've known each other for 20 plus years,\\nI'm depressed.\\nNow I've told you,\\nI don't need you to do anything,\\nI don't need you to help me,\\nI don't need you to like make me dinner.\\nI'm just telling you,\\nthis is why I'm isolating\\nor not wanting to hang out or whatever.\\n- It's really interesting with\\nyour best friend of 20 years\\nthat there's a part of you that\\nreally wanted to make sure\\nthat there was no opportunity for him\\nto take care of you, to support you.\\nYou needed even at moment\\nto take care of him.\\nWell, in that moment,\\nyou created an opportunity\\nfor you to take care of him\\nby telling him I'm depressed,\\nbut I don't need anything,\\nlet me take care of you\\nby telling you I have no needs.\\n- Yeah, that's true, yeah, geez.\\nOkay, yeah, that's true.\\nYeah, no, you're right.\\n- And is that common for you\\nas far as like being\\npotentially in dire need?\\n- Yeah, it is.\\n- Or no?\\n- It is common for me to handle it myself,\\nwhatever it is, it's uncommon for me...\\n- Is that a problem?\\n- Maybe sometimes, you\\nknow, maybe sometimes it is.\\n- Was it a problem in May?\\n- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.\\nIn some ways it was the\\ncause of the problems,\\nand then it was the\\nprolonging of the problems\\n'cause looking back Dr. Lamb, I know,\\nwell, I was just about to do it again,\\nI was just about to say all the things\\nthat I could have done\\ndifferently to handle this.\\n- You could have done\\nto take care of yourself\\nand not be a burden for anyone else.\\n- Right, right, right.\\nI even, this is so... I even...\\nSo I live in Phoenix.\\nI even like intensely\\nlooked at moving to Texas,\\nand my whole family is in Arizona.\\nAnd I have a lot of friends\\nin Arizona and I was like,\\nthis isn't working,\\nI need to go do my own thing\\nand move in my own space.\\nI'm gonna go look at Texas,\\nand then I found it was the\\nmosquito capital of the country,\\nand I was like, well,\\nI'm not moving to Dallas,\\nbut I really heavily looked at that.\\nIt's not like I had the thought,\\nI mean, I went online,\\nI called people I knew in Texas.\\nI was like, let's look\\nat me moving to Texas,\\nand this was in my deepest,\\ndarkest spot I was doing.\\n- How beautiful to recognize,\\nmore parts of this pattern\\nwhere when you're feeling poorly,\\nthat there's a part of you that says\\nI don't need, I don't deserve,\\nI don't want help, I\\ndon't wanna be a burden.\\nAnd it can come out in\\nlots of different ways.\\nI can do this on my own,\\nbut how does that hurt you?\\n- Well, I don't think I can\\nreally do it on my own at least,\\nand have the results that I do want.\\nSo that's how it hurts me.\\n- Is that a problem of performance\\nor a problem meaning,\\nI could be wrong here,\\nbut something about the way you said that\\nsounded like an attack on you,\\nlike, I can't do it on my own\\nif I could, I should.\\n- Oh, right.\\n- Different from, as a human,\\nwhen I'm suffering and in need,\\nI shouldn't want or need this human desire\\nto be connected with and taken care of.\\nThat there's real barriers to being seen,\\nto being taken care of\\nor letting people in\\nto be able to support\\nyou and take care of you.\\n- Yeah.\\n- What's coming up as I say that,\\nwhat do you notice inside?\\n- Well, I notice now I'm overwhelmed\\nbecause I believe this to be true\\nand this being this kind of,\\nwell, I mean, this is kind of\\nself sabotage, so to speak.\\nAnd now I'm overwhelmed\\nbecause I get to that point,\\nwhich a lot of people do and\\nmyself included in therapy,\\nwhere I go, great,\\nnow we've uncovered all of this,\\nnow what do I do?\\nIt's like, what do I do with all of this?\\n- Yeah and so great to notice,\\nthat as we start to notice something,\\na mechanism inside,\\nI would in my terminology,\\nI call it a defense.\\nAs this defensive avoidance,\\nwhen you're feeling\\nreally poorly comes in,\\npushing people away potentially\\nto get the care that\\nyou might want or need,\\nyou can then attack yourself\\nfor doing it or jump to,\\nokay, how do I fix this?\\nBut if we slow the process down\\nand we just get clear that\\nbecause first we have to\\nreally orient to the problem,\\nthat these depressive\\nepisodes can come up,\\nhard feelings can come up,\\nand that the way that you've learned\\nto operate in the world,\\nlikely for good reason,\\nwe don't learn this out of the womb,\\nwe learn to not be a burden,\\nto take care of ourselves,\\nto be able to say, I'm good.\\nYou know what? I'm so good,\\nI'm gonna go to Texas 'cause\\nI don't need any y'all.\\n- And you know what?\\nYou know where I went when I\\ngraduated college from Arizona?\\nI went to an island in Hawaii.\\nAnd sometimes I think\\nabout that and I go, man,\\nyou really wanted some space.\\nAnd in the context of this conversation,\\nI think there was a part\\nof it that I was like,\\nokay, I'm good, I don't need anybody.\\n- So this is a super important\\npoint about our defenses\\nis that not only do they make sense,\\nif we learned it's not okay to have needs\\nor to need to be taken care of,\\nor that we're seen as a burden,\\nwe learned to not do that,\\nand then we get wedded to\\nit and we get proud of it.\\nYou're self-sufficient,\\nyou can go to an island in Hawaii\\nand you can take care of yourself.\\nI got this, and you do,\\nand we don't have to demo\\neverything that you learned,\\nit's not a complete demo.\\nBut can we also create space that maybe\\npart of that way of operating,\\nwhen it's rigid,\\nwhen there isn't choice around it,\\nwhen it's unconscious\\nand potentially impulsive\\ncan be really destructive to you\\nand can keep you alone\\nand keep you hidden from other people\\nso they never really know\\nhow you're really doing\\nor know how to intervene to support you.\\nAnd so this is at the very beginning,\\nwhen we start therapy,\\nwe have to get clear what's the problem,\\nwhat are the things that\\nhow I may be operating\\nthat may be causing problems in my life.\\nAnd gosh, as we look at this one,\\nit sounds as though it's really mixed.\\nThere's a part of you it sounds like,\\nand correct me if I'm wrong,\\nthat is really proud of\\nyour capacity to do this.\\n- No question, no question.\\n- I don't need anybody.\\n- That's right.\\n- And so then we come\\nback to the question,\\nis it a problem?\\n- Is that a problem?\\n- Is it a problem?\\n- It is a problem,\\nI think for me to move through the world\\nwith that type of mindset,\\nand the problem is that it\\nkeeps me from the potential.\\n- The potential of what?\\n- Anything, the potential\\nof getting better faster,\\nthe potential of being happier,\\nthe potential of having\\ncloser relationships,\\nof showing vulnerability,\\nall of those things.\\n- Absolutely, yeah.\\nThat when we operate in this way,\\nwhich is super common, it's protective,\\nbut it can have catastrophic\\neffects on our relationships,\\nour capacity to connect,\\nand our sense of gosh,\\nbeing able to rely on\\nanyone, even a therapist.\\nBecause if you come into\\ntherapy and you're good,\\nyou could stay on that\\nisland on the couch.\\nAnd so before diving into all the feelings\\nand all that kinda stuff,\\nwe have to get clear, what's an operation,\\nwhat's the root cause\\nthat may be perpetuating\\nsome of this depression\\nand get clear, is this a problem\\nthat I really wanna work on\\nknowing that there's a part of it\\nthat I really wanna hold on to.\\n- Yeah, yeah, good.\\nDamn, really good, obviously.\\n- What do you notice inside\\nas we start to just identify this as,\\nI'd call it right now a potential problem,\\n'cause there's a part\\nof you that's really,\\nwants to stay on that island.\\nWhat do you notice coming up inside?\\nEven feelings that come up\\ntowards me as I highlight it.\\n- My feelings are that I,\\nI don't know if it's a feeling,\\nbut my thoughts are that\\nI have to go be by myself\\nand think about all of this\\nand maybe I shouldn't.\\n- Ain't that interesting?\\nEven here with me, as we start to connect\\nand start to get clear\\nabout what you might wanna work on,\\nit brings up some\\nfeelings about connecting,\\ncould get you anxious and say, okay,\\nI'm gonna go take this to my island\\nand go figure this out.\\n- I know, I really thought\\nI was like, after this,\\nI have an hour break in my day,\\nI can go and really think\\nabout this by myself.\\n- You should go do therapy with yourself.\\nWhat's it like to just notice that?\\n- Well, it's kind of funny,\\nhonestly, it's kind of funny.\\nI guess it's not too surprising\\nwhen it's all laid out there,\\nit's kind of like seeing\\na completed puzzle\\nwhen you didn't think you\\nhad all the puzzle pieces.\\n- And we could see how even here with me,\\nit could flirt the\\nconnection here with me.\\n- I'm in therapy with\\nyou and I'm like, God,\\nI gotta get rid of the therapist\\nso I can go think about this.\\nYeah, yeah, that's avoidance or is it?\\n- Yeah, and any sense of what's\\ncoming up inside your body\\nof what you notice\\nas we're just kind of connecting here\\nand exploring this together.\\nAny feelings that come up towards me?\\n'Cause there's an impulse to get away.\\n- And I'm not just saying this\\nto try to be nice to you,\\nI don't think it's getting away from you,\\nit's getting away from this conversation.\\nIt's getting away from\\nthese things that are coming up\\nbecause there is an ease\\nto living in my boxes\\nof not letting any one in, I guess.\\n- Right, yeah, there's an ease to it,\\nand yet it also can\\nperpetuate that depression\\nand that isolation and the avoidance.\\nBecause when stuff comes up for you,\\nthere's an impulse to get away\\nand to potentially push people away.\\n- Oh yeah, beautiful.\\n- And any sense of the feeling\\ninside of you towards\\nme that says step off,\\nwhat do you notice inside?\\nWhat's the feeling that\\ncomes up here towards me?\\n- Well, my feeling is that you're good.\\nTo me, I'm like, she's doing her job.\\n- And then there's a part\\nof you that then says,\\noh gosh, she could actually get in here.\\n- Yeah, yeah.\\n- No, I need to leave.\\nAnd so what's that\\nfeeling of I need to leave\\nthat comes up here with me?\\nWhat's the feeling inside\\nthat comes up here towards me,\\nthat's like, don't get too close?\\nWhat do you notice inside?\\n- I don't know that one.\\n- Would you like to know?\\n- Of course, yes, I trust you, yes.\\n- So what's the feeling\\nthat comes up inside here towards me\\nthat wants to push me away?\\nWhat feeling do you notice coming up?\\n- Well, I don't know again,\\nif this is a feeling,\\nbut the thought of I got it from here.\\n- And if you're setting that\\nboundary with me to say,\\nI got it from here,\\nwhat's the feeling that\\ncomes up here towards me?\\n- That I don't want you\\nto be involved with this\\nfrom this point on.\\n- Any feeling inside towards me?\\n- I don't... The feeling toward...\\n- 'Cause that's a thought\\nabout what you want to do,\\nwhat's the feeling towards me?\\nIf that feeling just\\ncomes out here towards me,\\nif we just let all your feelings be here,\\nwhat feelings come up here towards me?\\n- Well, now I'm feeling aggravated\\nthat I keep getting\\nasked the same question.\\nI'm like look I don't the feeling,\\nbut now I've gone into\\naggravated frustration.\\n- How do you feel that in\\nyour body here with me,\\nif we just let that be present?\\n- Well, when I said that\\nmy face got really hot,\\nI probably went flush.\\n- Beautiful, so there's feelings\\nthat come up here towards me\\nto try and keep me away.\\nAnd what's it like to\\njust let that feeling\\nbe present here with me?\\n- Uncomfortable.\\n- To be seen for your frustration,\\nlike the frustration that as I approach,\\nthere's a part of you that really wants\\nto be in therapy to connect,\\nand there's another part of you\\nthat really wants to push away,\\nand this is where we start\\nis just seeing that\\nso that we don't have a fake therapy\\nbecause often people come in\\nand have really mixed\\nfeelings about being seen.\\nAnd if your front door is closed,\\nwe can't really go\\nand take a look at your\\nfeelings and figure out,\\nand so then the work\\nbecomes here with you and me\\nto allow the space that\\nthere's a part of you\\nthat wants to connect\\nand a part of you that\\nwants to keep me at bay.\\nAnd that's okay, that's how most of us,\\nif we actually think about it,\\nengage in therapy,\\nwe're ambivalent.\\nBut if we don't look, we won't see that.\\nAnd then we do all kinds of things\\nto keep people at bay.\\n- Thank you for this.\\n- Absolutely, yes I know\\nI actually have to end.\\n- We have to go.\\nHey, I really appreciate it.\\nWe'll end there and thank\\nyou for this doctor.\\n- Is it okay if even like off the record,\\njust checking in what that experience was,\\nthis is an experience.\\n- It was really great\\nand I'm good and I'm\\nvery good and thankful\\nso I appreciate it.\\nIt was really wonderful,\\nI'm just in my thoughts\\nright now, so yeah,\\nand we are over time,\\nso you go do your thing\\nand thank you, thank you.\\n- Oh my gosh, no, thank you for\\nbeing so open and willing...\\n- Of course, you give me such a gift,\\nI really appreciate it, so thank you.\\n- Absolutely, nothing may come up,\\nbut please do feel free to reach out to me\\nyou know what I'm saying as we're...\\n- Yeah, I am very good, this has been...\\nThis is great, this is wonderful.\\nSo thank you, okay, all right.\\nBye y'all, thank you.\\n- Thanks.\\n- Thank you again to Dr.\\nLamb, that was great.\\nI have a lot to think about,\\nand thank you for watching.\\nWe are scheduled to do\\na part two of this video\\nwhere Dr. Lamb and I will kind of recap\\nwhat we went through\\nand discuss some of\\nthe things that came up\\nduring this mock therapy session.\\nIf you're interested in seeing that video,\\nmake sure you subscribe\\nand give a thumbs up to this video.\\nIt also helps share this content\\nwith more people who could need it.\\nIf you did make it all the way to the end,\\nleave me a comment,\\nletting me know that made\\nit through the entire video.\\nThank you for being here\\nand remember whatever you're\\ngoing through, you got this.\\nThanks for watching.\\nCheck out the links below\\nfor more information\\non how to access this full series\\nand subscribe to our YouTube channel\\nto watch new mental\\nhealth videos every week.\\nDid you like what you heard in this video?\\nIf you wanna ask a med circle\\ndoctor a question directly,\\nyou can learn how by visiting the links\\nin the description below.\\n(logo swoosh)\")], summary=\"The conversation revolves around a person, Kyle, who has been dealing with depression since childhood. Kyle shares his experiences of being on medication for much of his life and the struggles he faces when he goes off them, resulting in relapses. He expresses ambivalence about the idea of being on medication long-term.\\n\\nKyle discusses how he often finds himself overwhelmed by others' needs and admits that this may be a way to avoid facing his own issues. During a particularly challenging time in May, several factors, including medication changes, stressful work, and personal pressures, exacerbated his depression.\\n\\nHe recognizes a pattern where he might avoid dealing with his own feelings by focusing on helping others, which, while altruistic, leads to his own needs being unmet. His therapist, Dr. Lamb, helps him explore the deeper issues underlying his depression, highlighting how his self-sufficient attitude might actually lead to feelings of isolation and avoidant behaviors.\\n\\nThrough the session, Kyle begins to understand that while being self-sufficient and independent can be viewed positively, it may also prevent him from seeking support and fully connecting with others. The therapy process aims to help Kyle strike a balance between self-reliance and openness to support from those around him.\")]\n"
